# Remote Sensing of green (private) urban spaces

This repository contains the code for detecting vegetation in private gardens within dutch neighbourhoods. Vegetation detection is based on Color-infrared (CIR) aerial photography and the NDVI vegetation metric. 

The objective of this repository is to provide a base for spatial distribution analysis of urban green-grey-blue spaces. You may use it for developing custom made remote sensing applications. 

This so-called Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is an 100-day experiment of the Expertise Group Data Science Dutch Municipalities and acts as a showcase. 

Currently the application is a beta version.

You may test it and use it under the condition that you provide the project with feedback, improvements or extension. See Creative Commons licence below. 

## Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
Spectral indices dedicated to vegetation analysis are developed based on the principle that the healthy vegetation reflects strongly in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, while absorbing strongly in the visible red.

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared and visible red light. It distinguishes vegetation from soil, minimizes topographic effects
NDVI is chlorophyll sensitive, emphasizing the green color of a healthy plant.

NDVI-ranges vegetation in this research: 
       -1 to -0.1: water
       -0.1 to 0.2: sand/stone
       0.2 to 0.3: grasses, weed
       0.3 to 0.5: low to medium vegetation (substantial vegetation)
       0.5 to 1: intensive vegetation, high vegetation, trees

## Open Data 
The procedure generates insights based on open data:
- PDOK, nationaalgeoregister.nl (vector data)
- Aerial photo, opendata.beeldmateriaal.nl (raster data)
- Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland (AHN) (raster data) 

## Open Source
The procedure is available in both Python and R programming language. 

## Methodology
More information is available in the [presentation slides](https://datasciencevng.nl/s/fp97uFYyVmACYZuB)

## Instructions

Both the Python and R procedure result in geopackage (gpkg) files with multiples layers containing the results of the analysis. The geopackages can be deployed in QGIS or similar (commercial) GIS-software. 

## R
R: Open de Rproj-file in the R-directory to start the environment. Define the neighbourhood code(s) and municipality name in the neighbourhood.xlsx file. 
You may either use your own color infrared (CIR) aerial photo (must include infrared-band) or extract the area from the main  aerial photo of the Netherlands*. You may use tif or ecw as file-format. 

Please verify and adjust settings in '00_init_batch_run.R'
 
Run the procedure via '00_init_batch_run.R'

Output is served to DATA-directory (geopackages), PLOTS-directory and REPORT-directory (xls-sheets)

## Python
Python: Define the neighbourhood code(s) in the neighbourhood.csv file.
You may either use your own color infrared (CIR) aerial photo (must include infrared-band) or extract the region from the main aerial photo of the Netherlands*. You may
use ecw as file-format. Please verify and adjust settings in
'start.py'

Run the procedure via 'start.py'
