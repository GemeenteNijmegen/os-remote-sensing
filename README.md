# Remote Sensing: Green private urban spaces

This repository contains the code for detecting vegetation in private gardens within dutch neighbourhoods.
Vegetation detection is based on Color-infrared (CIR) aerial photography and the NDVI vegetation metric. 

The objective of this repository is to provide a base for developing custom made remote sensing applications for vegetation detection in the urban environment. 
This so-called Minimal Viable Product is an 100-day experiment of the Expertise Group Data Science Dutch Municipalities and acts as a showcase. 

Currently the application is a pre-release version (alpha).

You may test it and use it under the condition that you provide the project with feedback, improvements or extension. See Creative Commons licence below. 

## Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
Spectral indices dedicated to vegetation analysis are developed based on the principle that the healthy vegetation reflects strongly in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum, while absorbing strongly in the visible red.
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) quantifies vegetation by measuring the difference between near-infrared  
and visible red light. It distinguishes vegetation from soil, minimizes topographic effects
NDVI is chlorophyll sensitive, emphasizing the green color of a healthy plant.

NDVI-ranges vegetation in this research
       -1 to 0.2: non-vegetation; 
        0.2 to 0.3: grasses, weed; 
        0.3 to 0.5: low to medium vegetation (substantial vegetation); 
        0.5 to 1: #intensive vegetation, high vegetation, trees.

NDVI-range 'verstening'
       -0.1 tot 0.2: stone, sand/earth.

## Open Data 
The procedure extracts insights based on open data:
- PDOK, nationaalgeoregister.nl (vector data)
- Aerial photo, opendata.beeldmateriaal.nl (raster data)

## Open Source
The procedure is available in both Python and R programming language. 

## Methodology
More information is available in the [presentation slides](https://datasciencevng.nl/s/fp97uFYyVmACYZuB)

## Instructions

Both the Python and R procedure result in geopackage (gpkg) files with multiples layers which
can be visualized in QGIS or similar (commercial) GIS-software. 

R: Define the neighbourhood code(s) and municipality name in the neighbourhood.xlsx file. 
You may either use your own aerial photo (must included infrared-band) or extract the region
from the main  aerail photo of the Netherlands*. You may 
use tif or ecw as file-format. Please verify and adjust settings in 
'00_init_batch_run.R'
 
Run the procedure via '00_init_batch_run.R'

If you like to run the Python procedure from Rstudio, read the instructions in SRC>python.R

Python: Define the neighbourhood code(s) in the neighbourhood.csv file.
You may either use your own aerial photo (must included infrared-band) or extract the region
from the main aerial photo of the Netherlands*. You may
use ecw as file-format. Please verify and adjust settings in
'start.py'

Run the procedure via 'start.py'
